Journal Entry 3:

I can't believe the police! Discriminating against me
because of my accent, I know it! I was walking into
the university, and they had to stop me, search me and
have me bring them to my department head for proof.

They just couldn't believe an Arstotzkan would be
employed by their beloved university.
