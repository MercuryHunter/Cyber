Journal Entry 1:

Ahhh, today was a good day.

I saw a marvellous cat when I was out shopping.
Sleek black fur, piercing green eyes, I almost just
snatched it out of its owner's hands! Alas, I could
not, and continued procuring food...

The snow started falling about halfway through the day,
and I was reminded of my youth. Running around having
snowball fights, and then discovering the wonders of
computers and science.

I hope to instill this curiosity into my students!
