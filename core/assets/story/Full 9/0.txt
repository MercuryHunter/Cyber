Welcome to Cyber

You and your class mates have suffered through monotonous, semingly
never ending lectures...

It's time to change that, you've decided to make life easier... 
By hacking into your lecturers computer, you take control into
your own hands.

Every day that you finish hacking, you discover one of the journals
of your lecturer, and the faster you finish, the more favour you
earn with your classmates.

Some levels will take you many attempts, but in time you'll learn
your way through.
