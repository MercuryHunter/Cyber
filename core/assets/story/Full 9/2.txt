Journal Entry 2:

Ahhh, today was a good day.

The snow started falling about halfway through the day,
and I was reminded of my youth. Running around having
snowball fights, and then discovering the wonders of
computers and science.

I taught myself how to use and program them, and was
beguiled into the infinite depth of algorithms and
machines.

I hope to instill this into my students!
