This game is a story of "hacking the lecturer" to try and end lectures early.
Throughout playing you discover more and more of the background of your professor, and have tougher challenges to complete.

The menu has a couple of interactable elements - the cabinet for saves, the speakers for sound, and the laptops for levels.

Controls for the levels are the arrow keys, and the D key can be pressed for debug output.

All levels are beatable (though number 6 is tricky).

Notable Features include pixel perfect collision and an A-Star pathfinding algorithm.
Also, any level can be made with any tileset with the elements built-in, following a simple file format.

Future content includes: More levels, a favour system, minigames, spotquizzes, moving around in the game world and a winning screen.
